# Stress Prediction using Wearable Sensors

## Project Overview
This repository contains the final report and implementation for the internship project conducted at Indian Institute of Technology Jammu (IIT Jammu) under the supervision of Dr. Subhasis Bhattacharjee. The project focuses on optimizing stress prediction using wearable sensor data through advanced machine learning techniques.

## Abstract
The project aims to monitor real-time stress among frontline healthcare professionals, particularly nurses, using physiological data collected through wearable sensors. The comprehensive dataset includes electrodermal activity, heart rate, and skin temperature paired with subjective stress evaluations. The project advances through a systematic literature review, feature engineering, dataset balancing, and application of various machine learning models.
